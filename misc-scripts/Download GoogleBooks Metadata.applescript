-- Downloads GoogleBooks Metadata based on GoogleBook ID, or proposes a match with ISBN or record name
-- Based on a script to download DOI metadata by Kai Müller and Christian Grüenengerg; adapted to GoogleBooks API
-- Notes:
-- The script uses a numbers of custom metadata fields in Devonthink : ISBN/ISSN (is?n, identifier), Title (title, single-line text), Subtitle (subtitle, single-line text), Publication Year (publication-year, integer), Google Book ID (gbid, identifier), Authors (authors, multiline text). You can let it create them by running it successfully once and then refine their human-readable description.
